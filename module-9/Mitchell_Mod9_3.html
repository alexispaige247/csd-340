        <h2>Passages from the Hunger Games Book</h2>
        <p>"When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim's warmth but finding only the rough canvas of
            the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course she did. This is the day of the <span id="reaping">____</span>." (page 3)</p> 
        </p>
        <p> "Suddenly I am furious, that with my life on the line, they don't even have the decency to pay attention to me. That I'm being upstaged by a dead pig. My heart starts to pound, I can feel my face burning.
            Without thinking, I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers' table. I hear shouts of alarm as people stumbled back. the arrow skewers the apple in the pig's mouth and pins it to the wall behind it.
            Everyone stares at me in disbelief. 
            "Thank you for your <span id="consideration">____</span>," I say. Then I give a slight bow and walk straight toward the exit without being dismissed."" (page 101-102)
        </p>
        <p>""Handsome lad like you. There must be some <span id="special">____</span> girl. Come on, what's her name?" Says Caesar.
            "Peeta sighs. "Well, there is this one girl. I've had a crush on her every since I can remember. But I'm pretty sure she didn't know I was alive until the reaping." 
            Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to.
            "She have another fellow?" asks Caesar.
            "I don't know, but a lot of boys like her," says Peeta.
            "So, here's what you do. You win, you go home. She can't turn you down then, eh?" says Caesar encouragingly.
            "I don't think it's going to work out. Winning...won't help in my case," says Peeta.
            "Why ever not?" says Caesar, mystified.
            Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out. "Because...because...she came <span id="here">____</span> with me."" (page 130)
