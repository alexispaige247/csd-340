        <h1>Assignment 2.2 - Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p class="intro">To start, I was born Alexis Mitchell in Waconia, Minnesota, and I have two older brothers.
            We weren’t really close with my dad’s side of the family so I was raised near my grandparents on my mom’s side.
            She has 8 sisters and 4 brothers. <span class="sentence">It’s a very big family!</span>
            When I was 6 years old, we moved to Denver, Colorado mainly because my parents couldn’t stand the cold weather in Minnesota.
            We were only there for 4 years before we moved to Las Vegas, Nevada when living in Colorado became too expensive. We’ve been living here ever since.
        </p>
        <p>I spent most of my time either drawing or reading.
            I was told I always had a creative mind because I would write stories of my own or always coloring in some book.
            It wasn’t until I got enough money of my own that I got my own PC and started playing video games.
            I used to watch a lot of Youtubers growing up and experience video games when they would play them.
            Now, I’m able to play the games myself and have my own original experience.
        </p>
        <p>Video games are what got me interested in wanting to learn how to code.
            Growing up on the Internet, learning skills on the computer came easier to me than most things.
            Exploring my interest in video games, I wanted to be able to create a video game of my own.
            I knew I wanted to get a college degree, but I couldn’t figure out what I wanted to major in that I would be satisfied with.
            Fortunately, I was able to get a scholarship opportunity to pursue a Software Development degree that can lead me to finding a career that I’ll be happy with.
            What I really hope for is to end up working at a gaming company and help create an amazing video game.
        </p>
        <p>While pursuing this, I’ve had some interesting experiences happen in the last few years.
            The biggest thing is that my dad found his biological father (Harley) through ancestry.com.
            Grandma had my dad when she was very young and claimed that she didn’t know who the father was.
            50 years later, we found Harley and he had no idea he had a lost son.
            I think the wildest part about it is that Harley was only 20 minutes from where my dad grew up.
            So I gained a new set of grandparents and two uncles that we never knew about. Pretty crazy!
